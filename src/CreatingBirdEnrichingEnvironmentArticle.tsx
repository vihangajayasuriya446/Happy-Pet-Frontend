                        Why Enrichment Matters for Birds
                    </Typography>

                    <Typography paragraph>
                        In the wild, birds spend their days flying, foraging, socializing, and problem-solving. Captive birds have the same physical and mental needs but limited opportunities to fulfill them. Environmental enrichment bridges this gap, preventing boredom and unwanted behaviors like feather plucking, excessive screaming, and aggression.
                    </Typography>

                    <Typography paragraph>
                        A properly enriched environment keeps your bird physically active, mentally stimulated, and emotionally satisfiedâ€”contributing to their overall health and happiness.

                        <Typography paragraph>
                            <strong>Strategic perch placement:</strong> Position perches at different heights and distances to encourage movement. Use various materials (natural wood, rope, cement) and diameters to exercise feet and prevent foot problems.
                        </Typography>

                        <Typography paragraph>
                            <strong>Multiple feeding stations:</strong> Spread food and water dishes throughout the cage to promote movement and mimic natural foraging behavior.
                        </Typography>

                        <Typography paragraph>
                            <strong>Cage positioning:</strong> Place the cage in a location where your bird can observe household activities while still having a quiet retreat. Provide partial coverage for security.

                            <strong>Rotation system:</strong> Regularly rotate toys and perches to maintain novelty and interest. A good rule is to change 1-2 items weekly while keeping some favorites constant.

                        An enriched environment is essential for your bird's psychological and physical wellbeing. By providing a variety of stimulating activities and opportunities for natural behaviors, you help prevent boredom and unwanted behaviors while strengthening your bond.

                    <Typography paragraph>
                        Remember that different bird species have different enrichment needs, and individuals within species have their preferences. Observe what engages your particular bird most, and adapt accordingly.
