                            Consider adopting from rescue organizations where many birds, especially larger parrots, need loving homes. Rescues can often match you with a bird whose personality and needs align with your lifestyle. While rescue birds may come with behavioral challenges, experienced staff can guide you through these issues and the reward of giving a bird a second chance is immeasurable.

                        Remember that while species characteristics provide general guidelines, each bird is an individual with its own unique personality. Spend time interacting with different species before making your decision, and consider the bird's temperament as well as your lifestyle compatibility.
